    bio: "Michael Bluth is the hard working (and therefore self-righteous) member of the Bluth family. Never getting the natural favor that his older brother received, Michael worked hard to gain his father's approval. His father, meanwhile, decided to never show favor as a motivation technique. Michael married his college sweetheart Tracey and they became happy parents to George Michael Bluth.",

His greed led him to the life of a magician, among other quick-income professions such as male stripping. After receiving media attention revealing how an illusion worked, G.O.B. was blacklisted from magic and struggled to make his way back into the inner circle. ",

    bio: "Buster Bluth, real name Byron, is the baby of the Bluth family, despite being in his thirties. He is extremely dependent on his mother Lucille, perhaps because he spent 11 months in her womb. Although raised to believe George was his father, he eventually learned that Oscar Bluth, George's identical twin brother, was having an affair with Lucille and is probably his biological father. Buster was a scholar until the family went broke, and served in Army for a moment until his left hand was bitten off by a loose seal. ",

Appreciated only for her looks by her parents, Lindsay began acting out in rebellion, including moving to Boston, marrying Tobias Fünke and hosting charity dinners to spend her time. Lindsay and Tobias had to turn to a doctor to get pregnant but eventually gave birth to Maeby Fünke.",
